**FastScapeLib** is an interface or library (i.e. a set of subroutines) to model landscape evolution by river incision, sediment transport and deposition in continental environments.

**FastScapeLib** is a set of routines that solve (a) the stream power law (SPL) that has been enriched by a sediment transport/deposition term (see Yuan et al, 2019a in <<References>>) and (b) hillslope diffusion, using a set of highly efficient algorithms that are all O(n) complexity and implicit in time. These routines can be called from a ForTran, C or python main program and is ideally suited to be coupled to a tectonic model, be it very simple, such as a flexural isostatic model, or very complex, such as a 3D thermo-mechanical model.

== Getting started

To install **FastScapeLib**, you must first compile it. It has been written in ForTran 90. To compile it you will need the gnu ForTran compiler, gForTran, as well as the make utility/command. To compile, simply issue the following set of line commands:
----
tar xzvf FastScapeLib_V2.5.tar.gz
cd FastScapeLib_V2.5
make
----

To use **FastScapeLib** you will need to first write a program (in your favorite language) which calls the **FastScapeLib** subroutines. Several examples can be found in the `Examples` folder.

=== Installing ForTran

The best way to install a ForTran compiler on a Mac OS machine is to download it at link:http://hpc.sourceforge.net[SourceForge]. However you will first need to install `XCode` from the Apple App Store (free but voluminous) and make sure that you have access to the command-line tools by issuing (after installing XCode) the following command in a terminal:
----
xcode-select --install
----

== List of subroutines

**FastScapeLib** contains the following routines:

=== FastScape_Init

This routine must be called first, i.e. before calling any other subroutine of the inteface. It resets internal variables.

This routine has no argument:

`FastScape_Init ()`

[NOTE]
====
`ny` can be different from `nx`
====

`kf` ::

array of dimension `(nx*ny)` containing the bedrock river incision (SPL) rate parameter (or Kf) in meters (to the power 1-2m) per year (double precision)

`kfsed` ::

sediment river incision (SPL) rate parameter (or Kf) in meters (to the power 1-2m) per year (double precision); note that when `kfsed < 0`, its value is not used, i.e., kf for sediment and bedrock have the same value, regardless of sediment thickness

[NOTE]
====
bedrock refers to situations/locations where deposited sediment thickness is nil, whereas sediment referes to situations/locations where sediment thickness is finite
====

`m` ::

drainage area exponent in the SPL (double precision)

`n` ::

slope exponent in the SPL (double precision)

[WARNING]
====
Valuers of `n` different from unity will cause the algorithm to perform Newton-Raphson iterations, which will cause it to slow down substantially (by a factor order `n` when `n > 1`)
====

`g` ::

bedrock dimensionless deposition/transport coefficient for the enriched SPL (double precision)

[WARNING]
====
When `g > 0`, the algorithm requires that Gauss-Seidel iterations be performed; depending on the value of `g`, the number of iterations can be significant (from 1 when `g` is near 0 to 20 when `g` is near 1)
====

`gsed` ::

sediment dimensionless deposition/transport coefficient for the enriched SPL (double precision); note that when `gsed < 0`, its value is not used, i.e., g for sediment and bedrock have the same value, regardless of sediment thickness

[NOTE]
====
`p = 0.d0` corresponds to a uniform distribution of flow among receivers, regardless of the slope;

`p = 10.d0` (equivalent to `p` = infinity) corresponds to single direction flow or steepest descent;
====

[WARNING]
====
`p = -1.d0` (or any negative value for `p`) corresponds to an exponent that varies with slope according to: `p = 0.5 + 0.6*slope`
====

=== FastScape_Set_BC

This routine is used to set the boundary conditions

Arguments:

`FastScape_Set_BC ( ibc)`

`ibc` ::

`ibc` is made of four digits which can be one or zero (ex: `1111` or `0101` or `1000`); each digit corresponds to a type of boundary conditions (`0` = reflective and `1` = fixed height boundary); when two reflective boundaris face each other they become cyclic. The four bonudaries of the domain correspond to each of the four digits of ibc; the first one is the bottom boundary (`y=0`), the second is the right-hand side boundary (`x=xl`), the third one is the top boundary (`y=yl`) and the fourth one is the left-hand side boundary (`x=0`) (integer).

[NOTE]
====
The fixed boundary condition does not imply that the boundary cannot be uplifted; i.e. the uplift array can be finite (not nil) on fixed height boundaries. To keep a boundary at base level, this must be specified in the uplift rate array, `u`, used in `FastScape_Set_U (u)` subroutine.
====

== Examples

Several examples are provided in the `examples` directory. They are meant to be used as templates by the user. To compile them, first copy (and create them if you have not done so yet) the libraries `libFastScape.a` and `FastScape.so` from the `FastScapeLib` directory (where you have compiled/created them) into the `examples` directory:

----
cp libFastScape.a examples/.
cp FastScape.so examples/.
----

Then, in the `examples` directory, compile the ForTran examples using the `gForTran` compiler:

----
gForTran -O Mountain.f90 -L. -lFastScape -o Mountain
gForTran -O Margin.f90 -L. -lFastScape -o Margin
gForTran -O Fan.f90 -L. -lFastScape -o Fan
----

This should create executables that you can then execute. For example for the `Mountain` examples:

----
rm VTK/*.vtk
./Mountain
----

The first line is needed to remove any pre-existing `.vtk` file in the `VTK` directory.

=== Mountain.f90

This is the basic square mountain problem where a landscape is formed by a uniform uplift, all four boundaries being kept at base level. The resolution is medium (400x400). The SPL is non linear (n = 1.5) but no sediment effect is included (g = 0). Single direction flow is selected by setting `expp = 20`. The model run lasts for 10 Myr (100 time steps of 100 kyr each).

This model should run in approximately 60-70 seconds on a reasonably fast modern computer.

=== Fan.f90

Example of the use of the continental transport/deposition component of **FastScapeLib**.

Here we create a sedimentary fan at the base of an initially 1000 m high plateau. The model is relatively small (10x20 km) and low resolution (101x201). The erosion law is linear (n = 1) but sediments are more easily eroded (by a factor 1.5). Sediment transport/deposition is strong (g = 1). Multiple direction flow is selected. Boundary conditions are no flux boundaries except along the bottom boundary where base level is fixed at sea level (0 m).

This model should run in approximately 10 seconds on a reasonably fast modern computer.

=== DippingDyke.f90

Example of the use of spatially and temporally variable erodibility

Here we look at the effect of a resistant dyke dipping at 30 degree angle and being progressively exhumed. The dyke's surface expression progressively traverses the landscape and affects the drainage pattern.

The model, otherwise, is very simple: block uplift, all boundaries at base level, linear SPL, multiple direction flow and no sediment.

=== FastScape_test.ipynb

**FastScapeLib** Fortran routines can also be called directly from Python (and potentially from other languages such as C, C++ or MatLab) as illustrated in this example.

This is a simple (low resolution) example where the right-hand side of a rectangular model is an initially 100 m high plateau subjected to erosion, while the left-hand side is kept fixed at base level. The SPL is linear (`n = 1`) but completed by a sediment transport/deposition algoithm with `g = 1`.

Boundary conditions are closed except for the left hand-side (bounday number 4) set to base level.

The model is run for 200 time steps and the results are stored in `.vtk` files where the drainage area is also stored.

The drainage area of the last time step is also shown as a contour plot as shown in Figure <<#img-FastScapePyhton>>

== Auxiliary routines

=== Flexure

We provide a ForTran subroutine called `flexure` to compute the flexural isostatic rebound associated with erosional loading/unloading. This routine is not part of **FastScapeLib** and should be regarded as a simple example of a tectonic model that uses the interface. For this reason, it is provided as part of a different library or set of subroutines that do not have access to the **FastScapeLib** internal variabiles. All necessary variables must be passed to `flexure`.

Here we only describe the main subroutine. It takes an initial (at time `t`) and final topography (at time `t+Dt`) (i.e. before and after erosion/deposition) and returns a corrected final topography that includes the effect of erosional/depositional unloading/loading.

The routine assumes a value of 10^11^ Pa for Young's modulus, 0.25 for Poisson's ratio and 9.81 m/s^2^ for g, the gravitational acceleration. It uses a spectral method to solve the bi-harmonic equation governing the bending/flexure of a thin elastic plate floating on an inviscid fluid (the asthenosphere).

Arguments:

`flexure ( h, hp, nx, ny, xl, yl, rhos, rhoa, eet, ibc)`

`h` ::
array of dimension (`nx*ny`) containing the topography at time `t+Dt`; on return it will be replaced by the topography at time t+Dt corrected for isostatic rebound (double precision)

`hp` ::
array of dimension (`nx*ny`) containing the topography at time `t`, assumed to be at isostatic equilibrium (double precision)

`nx` ::
model topography (`h`) resolution or number of grid points in the x-direction (integer)

`ny` ::
model topography (`h`) resolution or number of grid points in the y-direction (integer)

`xl` ::
x-dimension of the model topography in meters (double precision)

`yl` ::
y-dimension of the model topography in meters (double precision)

`rhos` ::
array of dimension(`nx*ny`) containing the surface rock density in kg/m^3^ (double precision)

`rhoa` ::
asthenospheric rhoc density in kg/m^3^ (double precision)

`eet` ::
effective elastic plate thickness in m (double precision)

`ibc` ::
same as in <<FastScape_Set_BC>>

An example of code using the flexure routine can be found in the `EXAMPLE` directory. It is called `flexure_test.f90`. It shows how to use `flexure` but also how it interacts with **FastScapeLib**: it needs the topography computed by **FastScapeLib** as input to `flexure` but also needs to set the topography and basement geometry to the new values estimated by `flexure`.

To compile it, the user must first make the `flexure` library (`libflexure.a`) that must then be copied from the `Flexure2D_V1.0` directory into the `EXAMPLE` directory:

----
cd Flexure2D_V1.0
make
cd ../examples
cp ../Flexure2D_V1.0/libflexure.a .
gfortran -O3 flexure_test.f90 -L. -lFastScape -lflexure -o flexure_test
----

== Calling from Python

The subroutines of **FastScapeLib** can be called from `python`. You will first need to create a library that can be called from `python`. For this, best is to use the `f2py` command:

----
f2py -c --f90flags=-O3 -m FastScape FastScape_ctx.f90 FastScape_api.f90 StreamPowerLaw.f90 Diffusion.f90 Advect.f90 LocalMinima.f90

cp FastScape.cpython-37m-darwin.so FastScape.so
----

Once the `FastScape.so` library is created, you can import it in python, using:
----
import FastScape as Fp
----
for example.

See the Jupyter Notebook in the `examples` directory for further instructions on how to use **FastScapeLib** from within Python.
[WARNING]
====
Note that all routine names must be in lower caps in the calling python code.
