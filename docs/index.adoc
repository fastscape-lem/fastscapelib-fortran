**FastScapeLib** is an interface or library (i.e. a set of subroutines) to model landscape evolution by river incision, sediment transport and deposition in continental environments.

**FastScapeLib** is a set of routines that solve (a) the stream power law (SPL) that has been enriched by a sediment transport/deposition term (see Yuan et al, 2019a in <<References>>) and (b) hillslope diffusion, using a set of highly efficient algorithms that are all O(n) complexity and implicit in time. These routines can be called from a ForTran, C or python main program and is ideally suited to be coupled to a tectonic model, be it very simple, such as a flexural isostatic model, or very complex, such as a 3D thermo-mechanical model.

== Build and install FastScapeLib

**FastScapeLib** is not yet available as a binary package, so you need
to build and install it manually.

=== Download the source files

First, download the sources using git:

----
git clone https://github.com/fastscape-lem/fastscapelib-fortran
----

Alternatively, you can visit the URL of the source repository
(https://github.com/fastscape-lem/fastscapelib-fortran) and download
the source files as an archive (see the "clone or download button").

=== Requirements

To build FastScapelib, you need a Fortran compiler (e.g., `gfortran`,
part of GCC) and CMake (https://cmake.org/). Both can easily be
installed on major platforms, e.g., using Homebrew on MacOS or apt-get
on Linux/Debian. GCC compilers are also available for Windows platforms
(see http://www.mingw.org/).

=== Build using CMake

Run the following commands from the source directory to build the
**FastScapeLib** Fortran library:

----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake <options> ..
make
----

There are several build options, here shown with their default values:

- `-DBUILD_FASTSCAPELIB_STATIC=ON`: build fastscapelib as a static library
- `-DBUILD_FASTSCAPELIB_SHARED=OFF`: build fastscapelib as a shared library
- `-DBUILD_PYTHON_MODULE=OFF`: build the fastscapelib library as a Python module
- `-DUSE_FLEXURE=OFF`: include flexure routines in the library
- `-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF`: "build usage examples that are in the 'examples' directory

=== Install the Fortran library

If you want to install the **FastScapeLib** Fortran static/shared
libraries in your system, then simply run:

----
make install
----

You should now be able to link your programs using **FastScapeLib**
routines, e.g., with `-lfastscapelib_fortran`. See some Fortran programs
in the 'examples' folder.

=== Install the Python package

The recommended way of installing **FastScapeLib** as a Python package
is to run the following command from the source directory (i.e., the
top-level folder containing the file `setup.py`):

----
pip install .
----

This will also temporarily install all the tools needed to build the
package (except a Fortran compiler and Python/NumPy, which must be
both already installed). Note: you need pip >= 10.

You should now be able to import the package from within Python, e.g.,

----
>>> import fastscapelib_fortran as fs
----

There is a Jupyter notebook in the 'examples' folder showing simple
usage of the library.

== List of subroutines

**FastScapeLib** contains the following routines:

=== FastScape_Init

This routine must be called first, i.e. before calling any other subroutine of the inteface. It resets internal variables.

`kfsed` ::

sediment river incision (SPL) rate parameter (or Kf) in meters (to the power 1-2m) per year (double precision); note that when `kfsed < 0`, its value is not used, i.e., kf for sediment and bedrock have the same value, regardless of sediment thickness

[NOTE]
====
bedrock refers to situations/locations where deposited sediment thickness is nil, whereas sediment referes to situations/locations where sediment thickness is finite
====

`m` ::

drainage area exponent in the SPL (double precision)

`n` ::

slope exponent in the SPL (double precision)

[WARNING]
====
Valuers of `n` different from unity will cause the algorithm to perform Newton-Raphson iterations, which will cause it to slow down substantially (by a factor order `n` when `n > 1`)

[NOTE]
====
The fixed boundary condition does not imply that the boundary cannot be uplifted; i.e. the uplift array can be finite (not nil) on fixed height boundaries. To keep a boundary at base level, this must be specified in the uplift rate array, `u`, used in `FastScape_Set_U (u)` subroutine.

== Examples

Several examples are provided in the `examples` directory. They are meant to be used as templates by the user. To compile them, first copy (and create them if you have not done so yet) the libraries `libFastScape.a` and `FastScape.so` from the `FastScapeLib` directory (where you have compiled/created them) into the `examples` directory:

----
cp libFastScape.a examples/.
cp FastScape.so examples/.
----

Then, in the `examples` directory, compile the ForTran examples using the `gForTran` compiler:

----
gForTran -O Mountain.f90 -L. -lFastScape -o Mountain
gForTran -O Margin.f90 -L. -lFastScape -o Margin
gForTran -O Fan.f90 -L. -lFastScape -o Fan
----

This should create executables that you can then execute. For example for the `Mountain` examples:

----
rm VTK/*.vtk
./Mountain
----

The first line is needed to remove any pre-existing `.vtk` file in the `VTK` directory.

=== Mountain.f90

This is the basic square mountain problem where a landscape is formed by a uniform uplift, all four boundaries being kept at base level. The resolution is medium (400x400). The SPL is non linear (n = 1.5) but no sediment effect is included (g = 0). Single direction flow is selected by setting `expp = 20`. The model run lasts for 10 Myr (100 time steps of 100 kyr each).

This model should run in approximately 60-70 seconds on a reasonably fast modern computer.

=== Fan.f90

Example of the use of the continental transport/deposition component of **FastScapeLib**.

Here we create a sedimentary fan at the base of an initially 1000 m high plateau. The model is relatively small (10x20 km) and low resolution (101x201). The erosion law is linear (n = 1) but sediments are more easily eroded (by a factor 1.5). Sediment transport/deposition is strong (g = 1). Multiple direction flow is selected. Boundary conditions are no flux boundaries except along the bottom boundary where base level is fixed at sea level (0 m).

This model should run in approximately 10 seconds on a reasonably fast modern computer.

=== DippingDyke.f90

Example of the use of spatially and temporally variable erodibility

Here we look at the effect of a resistant dyke dipping at 30 degree angle and being progressively exhumed. The dyke's surface expression progressively traverses the landscape and affects the drainage pattern.

The model, otherwise, is very simple: block uplift, all boundaries at base level, linear SPL, multiple direction flow and no sediment.

=== FastScape_test.ipynb

**FastScapeLib** Fortran routines can also be called directly from Python (and potentially from other languages such as C, C++ or MatLab) as illustrated in this example.

This is a simple (low resolution) example where the right-hand side of a rectangular model is an initially 100 m high plateau subjected to erosion, while the left-hand side is kept fixed at base level. The SPL is linear (`n = 1`) but completed by a sediment transport/deposition algoithm with `g = 1`.

Boundary conditions are closed except for the left hand-side (bounday number 4) set to base level.

The model is run for 200 time steps and the results are stored in `.vtk` files where the drainage area is also stored.

The drainage area of the last time step is also shown as a contour plot as shown in Figure <<#img-FastScapePyhton>>

== Auxiliary routines

=== Flexure

We provide a ForTran subroutine called `flexure` to compute the flexural isostatic rebound associated with erosional loading/unloading. This routine is not part of **FastScapeLib** and should be regarded as a simple example of a tectonic model that uses the interface. For this reason, it is provided as part of a different library or set of subroutines that do not have access to the **FastScapeLib** internal variabiles. All necessary variables must be passed to `flexure`.

Here we only describe the main subroutine. It takes an initial (at time `t`) and final topography (at time `t+Dt`) (i.e. before and after erosion/deposition) and returns a corrected final topography that includes the effect of erosional/depositional unloading/loading.

The routine assumes a value of 10^11^ Pa for Young's modulus, 0.25 for Poisson's ratio and 9.81 m/s^2^ for g, the gravitational acceleration. It uses a spectral method to solve the bi-harmonic equation governing the bending/flexure of a thin elastic plate floating on an inviscid fluid (the asthenosphere).

Arguments:

`flexure ( h, hp, nx, ny, xl, yl, rhos, rhoa, eet, ibc)`

`h` ::
array of dimension (`nx*ny`) containing the topography at time `t+Dt`; on return it will be replaced by the topography at time t+Dt corrected for isostatic rebound (double precision)

`hp` ::
array of dimension (`nx*ny`) containing the topography at time `t`, assumed to be at isostatic equilibrium (double precision)

`nx` ::
model topography (`h`) resolution or number of grid points in the x-direction (integer)

`ny` ::
model topography (`h`) resolution or number of grid points in the y-direction (integer)

`xl` ::
x-dimension of the model topography in meters (double precision)

`yl` ::
y-dimension of the model topography in meters (double precision)

`rhos` ::
array of dimension(`nx*ny`) containing the surface rock density in kg/m^3^ (double precision)

`rhoa` ::
asthenospheric rhoc density in kg/m^3^ (double precision)

`eet` ::
effective elastic plate thickness in m (double precision)

`ibc` ::
same as in <<FastScape_Set_BC>>

An example of code using the flexure routine can be found in the `EXAMPLE` directory. It is called `flexure_test.f90`. It shows how to use `flexure` but also how it interacts with **FastScapeLib**: it needs the topography computed by **FastScapeLib** as input to `flexure` but also needs to set the topography and basement geometry to the new values estimated by `flexure`.

To compile it, the user must first make the `flexure` library (`libflexure.a`) that must then be copied from the `Flexure2D_V1.0` directory into the `EXAMPLE` directory:

----
cd Flexure2D_V1.0
make
cd ../examples
cp ../Flexure2D_V1.0/libflexure.a .
gfortran -O3 flexure_test.f90 -L. -lFastScape -lflexure -o flexure_test
----

== Calling from Python

The subroutines of **FastScapeLib** can be called from `python`. You will first need to create a library that can be called from `python`. For this, best is to use the `f2py` command:

----
f2py -c --f90flags=-O3 -m FastScape FastScape_ctx.f90 FastScape_api.f90 StreamPowerLaw.f90 Diffusion.f90 Advect.f90 LocalMinima.f90

cp FastScape.cpython-37m-darwin.so FastScape.so
----

Once the `FastScape.so` library is created, you can import it in python, using:
----
import FastScape as Fp
----
for example.

See the Jupyter Notebook in the `examples` directory for further instructions on how to use **FastScapeLib** from within Python.
[WARNING]
====
Note that all routine names must be in lower caps in the calling python code.
