== Examples

Several examples are provided in the `examples` directory. They are meant to be used as templates by the user. To compile them, use the CMake option `-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` (see <<install>> section for more details). This creates executables in the `examples` subfolder of your build directory. To run one of those examples, e.g., `Mountain`:

----
rm VTK/*.vtk
./Mountain
----

The first line is needed to remove any pre-existing `.vtk` file in the `VTK` directory.

=== Mountain.f90

This is the basic square mountain problem where a landscape is formed by a uniform uplift, all four boundaries being kept at base level. The resolution is medium (400x400). The SPL is non linear (n = 1.5) but no sediment effect is included (g = 0). Single direction flow is selected by setting `expp = 10`. The model run lasts for 10 Myr (100 time steps of 100 kyr each).

This model should run in approximately 90-100 seconds on a reasonably fast modern computer.

=== Margin.f90

Example showing the use of the Marine component of **FastScapeLib**.

An area of 100x150 km is set to uplift on one half only. The other half is 1000 m below sea level and accumulate sediment eroded from the uplifting area. The erosion model is nonlinear (n = 2) and sediment transport affects erosion (g = 1). Multiple direction flow is selected. Marine transport is 10 x more efficient for silt than sand. No compaction. Resolution is 100x150. Boundary conditions are no flux boundaries except along the bottom boundary where base level is fixed at -1000 m.

This model should run in approximately 90-95 seconds on a reasonably fast modern computer.

=== Fan.f90

Example of the use of the continental transport/deposition component of **FastScapeLib**.

Here we create a sedimentary fan at the base of an initially 1000 m high plateau. The model is relatively small (10x20 km) and low resolution (101x201). The erosion law is linear (n = 1) but sediments are more easily eroded (by a factor 1.5). Sediment transport/deposition is strong (g = 1). Multiple direction flow is selected. Boundary conditions are no flux on the top boundary, cyclic on the left and right boundaries and fixed height along the bottom boundary where base level is fixed at sea level (0 m).

This model should run in approximately 12 seconds on a reasonably fast modern computer.

=== DippingDyke.f90

Example of the use of spatially and temporally variable erodibility

Here we look at the effect of a resistant dyke dipping at 30 degree angle and being progressively exhumed. The dyke's surface expression progressively traverses the landscape and affects the drainage pattern.

The model, otherwise, is very simple: block uplift, all boundaries at base level, linear SPL, multiple direction flow and no sediment.

This model should run in approximately 25 seconds on a reasonably fast modern computer.

=== flexure_test.f90

This example shows how to use `flexure` but also how it interacts with **FastScapeLib**: the flexure module needs the topography computed by **FastScapeLib** as input to `flexure` but the user also needs to set the topography and basement geometry to the new values estimated by `flexure`. Running this model creates an ASCII file (`Fluxes.txt`) containing the fluxes coming out of the model.

This model should run in approximately 6 minutes on a reasonably fast modern computer.

=== FastScape_test.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook contains a simple (low resolution) example where the right-hand side of a rectangular model is an initially 100 m high plateau subjected to erosion, while the left-hand side is kept fixed at base level. The SPL is linear (`n = 1`) but completed by a sediment transport/deposition algoithm with `g = 1`.

Boundary conditions are closed except for the left hand-side (boundary number 4) set to base level.

The model is run for 200 time steps and the results are stored in `.vtk` files where the drainage area is also stored.

The drainage area of the last time step is also shown as a contour plot as shown in Figure <<#img-FastScapePyhton>>
