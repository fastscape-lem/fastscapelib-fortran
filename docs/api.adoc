[NOTE]
====
`ny` can be different from `nx`

=== FastScape_Set_Erosional_Parameters

This routine is used to set the continental erosional parameters

Arguments:

`FastScape_Set_Erosional_Parameters ( kf, kfsed, m, n, kd, kdsed, g, gsed, p)`

`kf` ::

array of dimension `(nx*ny)` containing the bedrock river incision (SPL) rate parameter (or Kf) in meters (to the power 1-2m) per year (double precision)

`kfsed` ::

sediment river incision (SPL) rate parameter (or Kf) in meters (to the power 1-2m) per year (double precision); note that when `kfsed < 0`, its value is not used, i.e., kf for sediment and bedrock have the same value, regardless of sediment thickness

[NOTE]
====
bedrock refers to situations/locations where deposited sediment thickness is less than 1 meter, whereas sediment refers to situations/locations where sediment thickness is greater than 1 meter
====

`m` ::

drainage area exponent in the SPL (double precision)

`n` ::

slope exponent in the SPL (double precision)

[WARNING]
====
Valuers of `n` different from unity will cause the algorithm to perform Newton-Raphson iterations, which will cause it to slow down substantially (by a factor order `n` when `n > 1`)
====

`kd` ::

array of dimension `(nx*ny)`  containing the bedrock transport coefficient (or diffusivity) for hillslope processes in meter squared per year (double precision)

`kdsed` ::

sediment transport coefficient (or diffusivity) for hillslope processes in meter squared per year (double precision; )note that when `kdsed < 0`, its value is not used, i.e., kd for sediment and bedrock have the same value, regardless of sediment thickness

`g` ::

bedrock dimensionless deposition/transport coefficient for the enriched SPL (double precision)

[WARNING]
====
When `g > 0`, the algorithm requires that Gauss-Seidel iterations be performed; depending on the value of `g`, the number of iterations can be significant (from 1 when `g` is near 0 to 20 when `g` is near 1). `g` must be equal or greater than zero.
====

`gsed` ::

sediment dimensionless deposition/transport coefficient for the enriched SPL (double precision); note that when `gsed < 0`, its value is not used, i.e., g for sediment and bedrock have the same value, regardless of sediment thickness

`p` ::

slope exponent for multi-direction flow; the distribution of flow among potential receivers (defined as the neighbouring nodes that define a negative slope)is proportional to local slope to power `p`

[NOTE]
====
`p = 0.d0` corresponds to a uniform distribution of flow among receivers, regardless of the slope;

`p = 10.d0` (equivalent to `p` = infinity) corresponds to single direction flow or steepest descent;
====

[WARNING]
====
`p = -1.d0` (or any negative value for `p`) corresponds to an exponent that varies with slope according to: `p = 0.5 + 0.6*slope`
====

`kds2` ::

[WARNING]
====
When `kds2` is not equal to `kds1`, it is possible that the algorithm fails to converge; the time step should be decreased until the maximum amount of sediment deposited in one time step is less than `L` the averaging depth; in theory, the convergence should not be affected when the increment in deposited sediment is higher than `L` and Xiaoping and Jean aere working on solving this problem
====

=== FastScape_Set_BC

This routine is used to set the boundary conditions

Arguments:

`FastScape_Set_BC ( ibc)`

`ibc` ::

`ibc` is made of four digits which can be one or zero (ex: `1111` or `0101` or `1000`); each digit corresponds to a type of boundary conditions (`0` = reflective and `1` = fixed height boundary); when two reflective boundaris face each other they become cyclic. The four bonudaries of the domain correspond to each of the four digits of ibc; the first one is the bottom boundary (`y=0`), the second is the right-hand side boundary (`x=xl`), the third one is the top boundary (`y=yl`) and the fourth one is the left-hand side boundary (`x=0`) (integer).

== Auxiliary routines

=== Flexure

We provide a Fortran subroutine called `flexure` to compute the flexural isostatic rebound associated with erosional loading/unloading. To use this routine, you need to enable the CMake option `-DUSE_FLEXURE=ON` when building **FastScapeLib** (see <<install>> section). By default, flexure is not part of the **FastScapeLib** library as it rather corresponds to a simple example of a tectonic model that uses the library interface.

Here we only describe the main subroutine. It takes an initial (at time `t`) and final topography (at time `t+Dt`) (i.e. before and after erosion/deposition) and returns a corrected final topography that includes the effect of erosional/depositional unloading/loading.

The routine assumes a value of 10^11^ Pa for Young's modulus, 0.25 for Poisson's ratio and 9.81 m/s^2^ for g, the gravitational acceleration. It uses a spectral method to solve the bi-harmonic equation governing the bending/flexure of a thin elastic plate floating on an inviscid fluid (the asthenosphere).

Arguments:

`flexure ( h, hp, nx, ny, xl, yl, rhos, rhoa, eet, ibc)`

`h` ::
array of dimension (`nx*ny`) containing the topography at time `t+Dt`; on return it will be replaced by the topography at time t+Dt corrected for isostatic rebound (double precision)

`hp` ::
array of dimension (`nx*ny`) containing the topography at time `t`, assumed to be at isostatic equilibrium (double precision)

`nx` ::
model topography (`h`) resolution or number of grid points in the x-direction (integer)

`ny` ::
model topography (`h`) resolution or number of grid points in the y-direction (integer)

`xl` ::
x-dimension of the model topography in meters (double precision)

`yl` ::
y-dimension of the model topography in meters (double precision)

`rhos` ::
array of dimension(`nx*ny`) containing the surface rock density in kg/m^3^ (double precision)

`rhoa` ::
asthenospheric rhoc density in kg/m^3^ (double precision)

`eet` ::
effective elastic plate thickness in m (double precision)

same as in <<FastScape_Set_BC>>
